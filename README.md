# synthetics-manager

This project has two goals:
* Be able to run your New Relic Synthethics locally. This lets you do things like debugging.
* Manage your New Relic Synthetics from the command line. Create new synthetics or update existing ones. This allows you to store the synthetics code under source code control.
